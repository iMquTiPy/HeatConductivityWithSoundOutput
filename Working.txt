-> To demonstrate heat conductivity with sound output we have used a strip of metal and heated it using a transistor circuit.
-> The metal strip gets heated because of the thermal power loss that occurs in the transistor.
-> The thermal power is determined by the collector current Ic and the voltage Vce across the transistor given by the equation:- 
        P = Ic Ã— Vce
->On the strip, we have drilled holes at 2-3 cm distance, and filled the holes with wax & attach a piece of nail in the hole with the wax.
->Below this setup we have put a xylophone. As the strip is heated, the wax in the nearest hole melts and the nail falls down and generates a sound.
-> As heat conducts across the strip, wax melts and falling nails produce sound.
